# GPTP Hooks
Here is where I will put miscellaneous hooks that may be useful for people to include in their own GPTP projects. Included are hooks I have made either for fun, at the request of others, or as part of other projects (notably the DatExtender GPTP fork).

These are all free to use and modify.
